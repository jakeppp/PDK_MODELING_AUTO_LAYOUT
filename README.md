# PDK_MODELING_AUTO_LAYOUT
**Complex System Agent Modeling and Multi-Objective Optimization**

We led the construction of a hybrid KNN+NN passive component prediction model, achieving 99% accuracy, compared to industry methods with <50% accuracy. We also built a GNN+RNN hybrid model to capture the mapping relationship between the graph characteristics of circuit topology and the S-parameter frequency domain, replacing high-cost simulations with a model error of <10%. Combined with the PSO algorithm, we achieved automatic optimization of layout parameters, increasing time efficiency by over 10 times.
